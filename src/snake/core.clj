;; main loop:
;; 1). check for collisions
;; 2). if there is a collision, flip out...
;; 3). ...unless it's food. in that case, make the food the head of the body
;; 4). generate a new food if the food is gone
;; 5). if you're not on food, remove the oldest part of the tail
;; 6). the head becomes the new block
